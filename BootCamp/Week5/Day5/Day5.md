#### 5. Auto-Scaling Cost Efficiency
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Auto-Scaling Cost Efficiency optimizes Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) and tools like Karpenter to dynamically adjust compute resources, minimizing costs during low demand.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps practice for elastic workloads (ASGs since 2009, Karpenter since 2021), it aligns with AWS Well-Architected (“Scale efficiently”).
  - **Importance**: Saves 30-60% during off-peak (e.g., $10K → $4K), scales to millions of users, and prevents over-provisioning (e.g., Netflix’s EKS).
  - **Features**: Dynamic scaling policies, Karpenter node optimization, Spot integration.
