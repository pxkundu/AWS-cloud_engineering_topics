## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a platform launched by GitHub in 2018 (generally available in 2019) to automate workflows within repositories. It enables developers to define custom pipelines using YAML files, triggered by events like code commits or pull requests, and executed on virtualized environments called runners. It’s widely adopted for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) but extends to tasks like compliance checks, notifications, and scheduled jobs.

---

## Theoretical Foundations

GitHub Actions builds on decades of automation theory, drawing from:
- **Workflow Automation**: Inspired by tools like Jenkins, it abstracts repetitive tasks into reusable steps, reducing human error and improving efficiency.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Rooted in reactive programming, it responds to repository events (e.g., `push`), aligning with modern microservices design.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: YAML workflows codify processes, enabling version control and reproducibility—core principles of DevOps.

Theoretically, it’s a blend of orchestration (managing job dependencies) and execution (running tasks on runners), optimized for GitHub’s ecosystem.

---

## Why GitHub Actions is Useful

GitHub Actions offers compelling advantages, making it a game-changer for development teams:

1. **Seamless Integration**: Embedded in GitHub, it eliminates the need for external CI/CD systems, reducing setup overhead and context-switching.
2. **Flexibility**: Supports any programming language or task—compile Java, deploy Docker containers, or run compliance scripts—all within one platform.
3. **Scalability**: From small startups to enterprises like JPMC, it scales with GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners, handling thousands of workflows.
4. **Community Ecosystem**: A marketplace of pre-built actions (e.g., `actions/checkout`) accelerates development by reusing battle-tested solutions.
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Free for public repos and includes generous minutes for private ones (e.g., 2,000 free minutes/month for private repos as of March 2025).
6. **Visibility**: Real-time logs and status in the GitHub UI enhance transparency, critical for team collaboration and auditing.

For a company like JPMC, GitHub Actions streamlines compliance, security, and deployment processes, aligning with the need for rapid, reliable software delivery in finance.

## Maintaining Industry Standards with GitHub Actions

Fortune 100 companies like JPMC operate under strict regulatory and operational standards (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS, GDPR). GitHub Actions supports these through:

1. **Security**:
   - **Secrets Management**: Encrypted variables and tokens ensure sensitive data (e.g., API keys) remain secure.
   - **Self-Hosted Runners**: Run workflows in private VPCs, meeting data residency and access control requirements.
   - **Auditability**: Workflow logs provide a tamper-proof record for compliance audits.

2. **Reliability**:
   - **Parallel Jobs**: Test multiple components simultaneously, reducing cycle time—a must for JPMC’s high-frequency transaction systems.
   - **Dependency Management**: Cache dependencies (e.g., Maven, npm) to ensure consistent builds.

3. **Standardization**:
   - **Reusable Workflows**: Define templates for consistent CI/CD across teams, enforcing JPMC’s coding and deployment standards.
   - **Policy Enforcement**: Use actions to check code quality (e.g., SonarQube) or compliance (e.g., linting for regulatory keywords).

4. **Scalability**:
   - **Auto-Scaling Runners**: Integrate with AWS Auto Scaling groups to handle peak loads, critical for JPMC’s global operations.

5. **Traceability**:
   - **Artifact Storage**: Store build outputs (e.g., JAR files) in GitHub Packages, linking them to specific commits for forensic analysis.

By embedding these practices, GitHub Actions aligns with DevOps principles (automation, collaboration, monitoring) and industry benchmarks like ISO 27001, ensuring JPMC meets its rigorous standards.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Workflow**: A YAML-defined process (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with jobs.
- **Event**: Triggers like `push`, `pull_request`, or `schedule` (cron-based).
- **Job**: A collection of steps running on a runner, parallel by default.
- **Step**: A single task—either a shell command or an action.
- **Action**: Reusable code (e.g., `actions/setup-java@v3`) from GitHub or the community.
- **Runner**: Execution environment—GitHub-hosted (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) or self-hosted.

---

## Setting Up GitHub Actions

### GitHub-Hosted Runners
- **Specs**: 2-core CPU, 7 GB RAM, 14 GB SSD.
- **Setup**: Add a workflow file with `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`.
- **Use Case**: Quick prototyping or open-source projects.

### Self-Hosted Runners
- **Control**: Customize hardware, OS, and network.
- **Setup**: Configure via GitHub UI, download runner software, and run it on your machine.
- **Use Case**: JPMC’s private workloads requiring VPC access or specific compliance tools.

## Example Project: JPMC Transaction Processing System

### Project Overview
Imagine JPMC needs a transaction processing system to handle real-time payments. This example simulates a microservices architecture with:
- **Backend**: A Java Spring Boot API for transaction processing.
- **Frontend**: A React dashboard for monitoring transactions.
- **Goal**: Build, test, and validate the system using GitHub Actions on a self-hosted AWS EC2 runner.

## Self-Hosted Runner on AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2)

### Setup Instructions
1. **EC2 Instance**:
   - AMI: Amazon Linux 2.
   - Type: `m5.large` (for JPMC’s performance needs).
   - VPC: Private subnet with NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.

2. **Install Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install -y docker libicu java-17-openjdk
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Configure Runner**:
   ```bash
   mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
   curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.323.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.323.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.323.0.tar.gz
   tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.323.0.tar.gz
   ./config.sh --url https://github.com/jpmchase/transaction-system --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
   sudo ./svc.sh install
   sudo ./svc.sh start
   ```

### Troubleshooting .NET Core Issues
- **Error**: `Libicu's dependencies is missing for Dotnet Core 6.0`.
- **Fix**: `sudo yum install -y libicu` before configuration.

---

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Use GitHub Secrets for API keys; run self-hosted runners in isolated environments.
- **Performance**: Cache Maven/npm dependencies (`actions/cache`).
- **Compliance**: Add steps for static analysis (e.g., Checkmarx) or regulatory linting.
- **Modularity**: Split workflows into build, test, and deploy jobs.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Slack/Teams for failure alerts.
