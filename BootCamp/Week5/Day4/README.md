### Key Learning Topics

#### 1. AWS Cost Anomaly Detection
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is an ML-driven tool that identifies unusual cost spikes in AWS spending patterns and alerts teams via email or SNS.
  - **Context**: Launched in 2020, it enhances DevSecOps cost governance by automating anomaly identification, aligning with the AWS Well-Architected Framework’s Cost Optimization Pillar (“Monitor and respond to cost anomalies”).
  - **Importance**: Detects unexpected costs (e.g., $5K spike from a forgotten EC2), scales to millions of resources, and prevents budget overruns (e.g., 2021 Zoom misconfig incident).
  - **Features**: Pattern-based detection, customizable sensitivity, root cause hints (e.g., “RDS usage increase”).
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Walmart’s Holiday Monitoring**: Walmart uses Cost Anomaly Detection during Black Friday (46M items sold, 2022), flagging a $10K RDS spike from unoptimized queries, saving $50K for 240M weekly customers.
    - **Example**: Alert: “RDS cost +300%” → Optimize read replicas → Back to $3K/day.
  - **Amazon’s Testing Oversight**: Amazon detects a $5K anomaly in dev EC2 usage for AWS service testing, saving $1M+ yearly across 1M+ customers by terminating forgotten instances.

#### 2. Cost Automation with Lambda
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Cost Automation with Lambda uses serverless functions to programmatically manage AWS resources (e.g., stop idle EC2, delete snapshots), triggered by events like CloudWatch or Budgets.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps automation staple (Lambda since 2014), it reduces manual intervention, aligning with AWS Well-Architected (“Automate cost management”).
  - **Importance**: Saves 50-70% on idle resources (e.g., $1K/month → $300), scales to 1000s of instances, and ensures cost discipline (e.g., NIST 800-53 CP-10 automation).
  - **Features**: Event-driven, low cost ($0.20/1M executions), Boto3 SDK for AWS control.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Airbnb’s Nightly Shutdowns**: Airbnb uses Lambda to stop dev EC2 instances nightly, saving $500K+ yearly for 100M+ bookings.
    - **Example**: Trigger: CloudWatch Schedule (10 PM) → `ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-123'])` → 66% savings.
  - **Amazon’s Snapshot Cleanup**: Amazon deletes 30-day-old EBS snapshots via Lambda, saving $200K+ for 1M+ customers’ storage.

#### 4. Spot Instances
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Spot Instances are spare AWS compute capacity offered at up to 90% discounts over On-Demand pricing, ideal for fault-tolerant, non-critical workloads.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps cost tactic (Spot since 2009), it leverages market pricing (AWS Well-Architected: “Use cost-effective resources”).
  - **Importance**: Saves millions for batch jobs (e.g., $0.10/hr → $0.01/hr), scales to elastic workloads, and requires interruption handling (e.g., 2-minute notice).
  - **Features**: Spot Fleet, Spot Blocks, integration with Auto Scaling.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Netflix’s Encoding**: Netflix runs video encoding on Spot Instances, saving $1M+ monthly for 247M subscribers’ 17B+ streaming hours.
    - **Example**: Spot Fleet: 100 `c5.xlarge` at $0.02/hr vs. $0.19/hr → $50K/month saved.
  - **Amazon’s Batch Jobs**: Amazon uses Spot for internal analytics, cutting $500K+ yearly for 1M+ customers’ data processing.

#### 5. Cost Forecasting
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Cost Forecasting in AWS Cost Explorer uses ML to predict future spend based on historical data, aiding budget planning and resource adjustments.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps planning tool (Cost Explorer forecasting since 2017), it aligns with AWS Well-Architected (“Plan costs proactively”).
  - **Importance**: Prevents overspending (e.g., $10K → $15K forecast), scales to seasonal peaks (e.g., Black Friday), and informs RI purchases.
  - **Features**: 12-month projections, confidence intervals (e.g., 80%), service-level forecasts.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Walmart’s Holiday Prep**: Walmart forecasts a $5M spike in RDS costs for November, reserving RIs to save $1M+ for 240M customers.
    - **Example**: Forecast: $5M → RI purchase → $4M actual.
  - **Amazon’s Service Growth**: Amazon predicts $10M EC2 growth for AWS, optimizing $2M+ yearly for 1M+ customers.

#### 6. Infrastructure Cost Optimization
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Infrastructure Cost Optimization adjusts cloud infrastructure (e.g., EKS node groups, ALB configs) to minimize costs while meeting performance needs.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps practice for advanced environments (e.g., Kubernetes since 2014), it uses tools like Karpenter for auto-scaling (AWS Well-Architected: “Optimize over time”).
  - **Importance**: Saves 20-50% on containerized apps (e.g., $10K → $5K), scales to microservices, and balances cost/performance (e.g., Netflix’s EKS).
  - **Tools**: Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, AWS Graviton instances.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Netflix’s Karpenter**: Netflix uses Karpenter to right-size EKS nodes, saving $500K+ yearly for 247M users’ microservices.
