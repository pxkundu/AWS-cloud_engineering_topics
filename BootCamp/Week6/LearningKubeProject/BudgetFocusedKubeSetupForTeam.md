Let’s organize your Kubernetes cluster for a team of four engineers, each working in their own namespace, while keeping costs in check and following industry-standard practices. Since you’re on a budget and the team is sharing a single cluster, we’ll focus on efficient resource management, isolation, security, and collaboration. I’ll draw on your past Kubernetes experience—like your setup with `k8s-master` and `k8s-worker1`, where you faced issues such as CoreDNS failures and `Ingress` misconfigurations—to ensure we address similar challenges proactively. The goal is to create a scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective setup that aligns with real-world DevOps practices.

### Industry-Standard Approach to Organize a Shared Kubernetes Cluster

#### 1. Namespace Isolation for Each Engineer
Namespaces in Kubernetes provide logical separation for resources, ensuring each engineer’s work is isolated while still sharing the underlying cluster infrastructure. This is a standard practice for multi-tenant clusters.

- **Create a Namespace for Each Engineer**:
  Assign each engineer a dedicated namespace to avoid resource conflicts and make debugging easier.
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace engineer1
  kubectl create namespace engineer2
  kubectl create namespace engineer3
  kubectl create namespace engineer4
  ```
- **Label the Namespaces**:
  Add labels for easier management and monitoring.
  ```bash
  kubectl label namespace engineer1 owner=engineer1
  kubectl label namespace engineer2 owner=engineer2
  kubectl label namespace engineer3 owner=engineer3
  kubectl label namespace engineer4 owner=engineer4
  ```

#### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Security
RBAC ensures engineers can only access their own namespaces, preventing accidental interference. This aligns with Kubernetes security best practices for multi-tenant environments.

- **Create a Role for Namespace-Level Access**:
  Define a `Role` that allows full access within a namespace but restricts cluster-wide operations.
  ```yaml
  # role.yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Role
  metadata:
    name: namespace-admin
    namespace: engineer1  # Replace with each engineer's namespace
  rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]
  ```
  Apply for each namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f role.yaml -n engineer1
  # Repeat for engineer2, engineer3, engineer4
  ```

- **Bind the Role to Each Engineer**:
  Use a `RoleBinding` to tie each engineer’s user or service account to their namespace’s `Role`.
  Assuming each engineer has a Kubernetes user (e.g., `engineer1-user`), create a `RoleBinding`:
  ```yaml
  # rolebinding.yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
    name: namespace-admin-binding
    namespace: engineer1  # Replace with each engineer's namespace
  subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: engineer1-user  # Replace with each engineer's user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  roleRef:
    kind: Role
    name: namespace-admin
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  ```
  Apply for each engineer:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml -n engineer1
  # Repeat for engineer2, engineer3, engineer4
  ```

- **Restrict Cluster-Wide Access**:
  Ensure engineers cannot modify cluster-wide resources (e.g., nodes, cluster roles). By default, the `Role` above only grants namespace-level access, which is sufficient.

#### 3. Resource Quotas and Limits for Cost Control
Since you’re on a budget, enforce resource quotas to prevent any single engineer from consuming too many resources, which could impact others or increase costs (e.g., on AWS, where node usage directly affects billing). This also addresses past issues in your cluster, like resource constraints on `k8s-master` that caused CoreDNS and control plane instability.

- **Set a ResourceQuota for Each Namespace**:
  Limit CPU, memory, and the number of pods per namespace to ensure fair usage.
  ```yaml
  # resource-quota.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: compute-quota
    namespace: engineer1  # Replace with each engineer's namespace
  spec:
    hard:
      requests.cpu: "2"      # Total CPU requests limit
      requests.memory: "4Gi" # Total memory requests limit
      limits.cpu: "4"        # Total CPU limits
      limits.memory: "8Gi"   # Total memory limits
      pods: "10"             # Maximum number of pods
  ```
  Apply for each namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml -n engineer1
  # Repeat for engineer2, engineer3, engineer4
  ```

- **Set Default Limits for Pods**:
  Use a `LimitRange` to enforce default CPU and memory limits for pods, preventing unbounded resource usage.
  ```yaml
  # limit-range.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: LimitRange
  metadata:
    name: default-limits
    namespace: engineer1  # Replace with each engineer's namespace
  spec:
    limits:
    - type: Container
      default:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "512Mi"
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: "200m"
        memory: "256Mi"
  ```
  Apply for each namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f limit-range.yaml -n engineer1
  # Repeat for engineer2, engineer3, engineer4
  ```

#### 4. Shared Resources and Collaboration
While each engineer has their own namespace, some resources (e.g., `Ingress` controllers, storage classes) might need to be shared to save costs.

- **Shared `Ingress` Controller**:
  Instead of each engineer deploying their own `Ingress` controller (which can be resource-heavy), deploy a single `Ingress` controller in a shared namespace (e.g., `ingress-nginx`).
  - Install the NGINX Ingress Controller:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
    ```
  - Each engineer can create `Ingress` resources in their namespace, pointing to the shared controller. Example for `engineer1`:
    ```yaml
    # ingress.yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: app-ingress
      namespace: engineer1
    spec:
      ingressClassName: nginx
      rules:
      - host: engineer1.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app-service
                port:
                  number: 80
    ```
    Apply:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n engineer1
    ```
  - **Cost Benefit**: A single `Ingress` controller reduces resource usage compared to multiple controllers, saving on node costs.

- **Shared Storage Class**:
  Use a single `StorageClass` for persistent storage (e.g., AWS EBS) to avoid redundancy.
  ```yaml
  # storage-class.yaml
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: StorageClass
  metadata:
    name: standard
  provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
  parameters:
    type: gp3
    fsType: ext4
  ```
  Apply:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f storage-class.yaml
  ```
  Engineers can reference this `StorageClass` in their `PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVCs).

#### 5. Monitoring and Observability
To keep costs low while ensuring visibility, use lightweight monitoring tools to track resource usage and detect issues early (e.g., similar to the CoreDNS `ContainerCreating` issue you faced).

- **Install Metrics Server**:
  The Metrics Server provides resource usage data for `kubectl top`, helping you monitor CPU and memory usage across namespaces.
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
  ```
  Verify:
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  kubectl top pods -n engineer1
  ```

- **Set Up Prometheus with Namespace Filtering**:
  Deploy a lightweight Prometheus instance to monitor the cluster, configured to scrape metrics only from the engineers’ namespaces to reduce resource usage.
  - Install Prometheus using the Helm chart:
    ```bash
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace monitoring --create-namespace \
      --set prometheus.serviceMonitorSelector="app=monitoring" \
      --set prometheus.serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector="matchNames=engineer1,engineer2,engineer3,engineer4"
    ```
  - This setup ensures Prometheus only monitors the specified namespaces, keeping resource usage low.

- **Alert on Resource Usage**:
  Configure basic alerts in Prometheus for high CPU/memory usage per namespace to catch issues before they impact the cluster.

#### 6. Cluster-Wide Policies for Stability
Enforce cluster-wide policies to prevent common issues, especially since your team previously encountered problems like control plane instability and networking failures.

- **Network Policy for Namespace Isolation**:
  Prevent pods in different namespaces from communicating unless explicitly allowed, enhancing security and reducing interference.
  ```yaml
  # network-policy.yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: deny-cross-namespace
    namespace: engineer1  # Replace with each engineer's namespace
  spec:
    podSelector: {}
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
    ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: engineer1  # Same namespace
    egress:
    - to:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: engineer1  # Same namespace
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system  # Allow DNS (CoreDNS)
  ```
  Apply for each namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml -n engineer1
  # Repeat for engineer2, engineer3, engineer4
  ```

- **Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) for Critical Components**:
  Ensure critical shared components (e.g., `Ingress` controller, Prometheus) remain available during node maintenance.
  ```yaml
  # pdb-ingress.yaml
  apiVersion: policy/v1
  kind: PodDisruptionBudget
  metadata:
    name: ingress-nginx-pdb
    namespace: ingress-nginx
  spec:
    minAvailable: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
  ```
  Apply:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f pdb-ingress.yaml
  ```

#### 7. Documentation and Collaboration
Document the setup and processes to ensure the team can collaborate effectively, especially since you’ve previously worked on detailed documentation (e.g., for Jenkins pipelines and Terraform projects).

- **Create a Shared README**:
  Add a `README.md` in a shared Git repository to document the cluster setup:
  ```markdown
  # Shared Kubernetes Cluster Setup

  ## Overview
  This cluster is shared among 4 engineers, each with their own namespace for resource isolation.

  ## Namespaces
  - `engineer1`: Owned by Engineer 1
  - `engineer2`: Owned by Engineer 2
  - `engineer3`: Owned by Engineer 3
  - `engineer4`: Owned by Engineer 4

  ## Resource Quotas
  - CPU Requests: 2 cores per namespace
  - Memory Requests: 4Gi per namespace
  - Pod Limit: 10 pods per namespace

  ## Shared Resources
  - **Ingress Controller**: Deployed in `ingress-nginx` namespace. Use `ingressClassName: nginx` in your `Ingress` resources.
  - **Storage Class**: `standard` (AWS EBS gp3).

  ## Monitoring
  - Use `kubectl top` to check resource usage.
  - Prometheus is deployed in `monitoring` namespace, scraping metrics from engineer namespaces.

  ## Best Practices
  - Always specify resource requests and limits in your pod specs.
  - Test `Ingress` rules locally before applying.
  - Monitor resource usage to avoid hitting quotas.
  ```
  Commit to your Git repository:
  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Add shared Kubernetes cluster documentation"
  git push origin main
  ```

- **Slack/Email Notifications**:
  Since you’ve previously worked with Slack notifications in Google Apps Script, set up a simple notification system to alert the team if resource quotas are nearing limits. Use a Kubernetes Event exporter (e.g., `event-exporter`) to send events to Slack.

#### 8. Cost Optimization Tips
Given your budget constraints, here are additional steps to minimize costs while maintaining functionality:

- **Use Spot Instances for Nodes** (if on AWS):
  Configure `k8s-worker1` to use spot instances, which are significantly cheaper than on-demand instances. Use the AWS Node Termination Handler to handle spot interruptions gracefully.
  ```bash
  helm install aws-node-termination-handler aws-node-termination-handler \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --set enableSpotInterruptionDraining=true
  ```

- **Schedule Non-Critical Workloads**:
  Encourage engineers to use `CronJobs` for non-critical workloads, running them during off-peak hours to reduce resource contention.

- **Downscale When Idle**:
  Use a tool like `kube-downscaler` to automatically scale down pods during periods of inactivity (e.g., nights/weekends).
  ```bash
  helm repo add kube-downscaler https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-downscaler
  helm install kube-downscaler kube-downscaler/kube-downscaler --namespace kube-system
  ```

---

### Addressing Past Issues in This Setup

- **CoreDNS `ContainerCreating` Issue**:
  - The `NetworkPolicy` allows egress to `kube-system` for DNS resolution, ensuring pods can reach CoreDNS.
  - Resource quotas and limits prevent resource exhaustion on `k8s-master`, which previously caused CoreDNS and control plane instability.

- **Control Plane Instability**:
  - Resource quotas ensure engineers’ workloads don’t overload the cluster, reducing strain on the control plane.
  - Monitoring with Metrics Server and Prometheus helps detect issues early.

- **Ingress Misconfiguration**:
  - A shared `Ingress` controller simplifies configuration and reduces the chance of errors like `target-type: ip` (which you faced with ALB).

---

### Next Steps

1. **Apply the Setup**:
   - Create namespaces, RBAC roles, and resource quotas as outlined.
   - Deploy shared resources like the `Ingress` controller and `StorageClass`.
   - Set up monitoring with Metrics Server and Prometheus.

2. **Test Access**:
   - Each engineer should test their access to their namespace using their `kubeconfig`:
     ```bash
     kubectl --namespace engineer1 get pods
     ```

3. **Monitor Resource Usage**:
   - Regularly check resource usage to ensure no namespace exceeds its quota:
     ```bash
     kubectl top pods -n engineer1
     ```

4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from the team on resource limits and adjust quotas if needed (e.g., increase CPU/memory for specific namespaces).

This setup follows industry standards for multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, balancing cost, security, and collaboration. Let me know if you’d like to adjust quotas or add more features like automated backups!
