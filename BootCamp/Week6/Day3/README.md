## Phase 3 Highlights: Secure and Monitor - Add Encryption/Alarms, Pass a Pen Test

### Plan
1. **Objective**: Harden the EKS cluster’s security, enhance observability, and validate resilience through penetration testing.
2. **Duration**: Approximately 7-8 hours.
3. **Focus Areas**:
   - Enhance security with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Network Policies, and Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper.
   - Add observability using AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray.
   - Pass a penetration test with `kube-hunter` to ensure no critical vulnerabilities.
4. **Approach**:
   - Build on Phase 2’s infrastructure and microservices.
   - Prioritize security-first design, real-time monitoring, and proactive validation.
   - Emulate industry-standard DevSecOps practices from companies like Google, Amazon, and Airbnb.
5. **Outcome**: A secure, observable EKS deployment ready for production, with validated security posture.

### Learning Points
1. **Kubernetes Security Fundamentals**:
   - Understanding RBAC for fine-grained access control within namespaces.
   - Applying Network Policies to enforce zero-trust networking in microservices.
   - Leveraging OPA Gatekeeper for automated policy enforcement (e.g., Pod Security Standards).
2. **DevSecOps Principles**:
   - Importance of least privilege and segmentation in reducing attack surfaces.
   - Value of observability for proactive issue detection and resolution.
   - Penetration testing as a critical step in validating security readiness.
3. **Observability in Action**:
   - Using CloudWatch for cluster and application metrics (e.g., CPU, custom business metrics).
   - Implementing X-Ray for tracing microservices interactions and latency analysis.
4. **Real-World Application**:
   - Learning how enterprises (e.g., Google’s GKE, Amazon’s EKS) secure and monitor Kubernetes clusters.
   - Gaining hands-on experience with tools like `kube-hunter` used in production environments.
5. **Industry Standards**:
   - Aligning with NIST 800-53 (e.g., access control, risk assessment) and AWS Well-Architected Framework (Security, Operational Excellence).

### Implemented Functionalities
1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - **RBAC**:
     - Defined roles and bindings to restrict access to `prod` namespace resources (Pods, Deployments, Services).
     - Implemented service account for microservices with minimal permissions.
   - **Network Policies**:
     - Restricted pod-to-pod traffic to allow only frontend-to-backend communication.
     - Denied all other ingress/egress by default for zero-trust networking.
   - **OPA Gatekeeper**:
     - Installed Gatekeeper to enforce Pod Security Standards.
     - Applied policy to deny privileged pods (e.g., no root access) in `prod` namespace.

2. **Observability Features**:
   - **CloudWatch**:
     - Enabled Container Insights for EKS metrics (CPU, memory usage).
     - Added custom metric (`orders/min`) to track business activity from the backend.
     - Set an alarm to trigger on CPU > 80% for proactive scaling alerts.
   - **AWS X-Ray**:
     - Integrated X-Ray daemon as a sidecar in backend pods.
     - Enabled tracing for API calls (`/inventory`, `/orders`) to monitor latency and dependencies.

3. **Penetration Testing**:
   - **kube-hunter**:
     - Ran penetration test to identify vulnerabilities (e.g., exposed API server, privilege escalation).
     - Remediated findings by tightening RBAC, Network Policies, and cluster configurations.
     - Re-validated to ensure no critical issues remained.

### Why This Phase Matters
- **Security Backbone**: Establishes a robust defense against internal and external threats, critical for production systems (e.g., blocking 95% of exploits, CNCF 2023).
- **Observability Foundation**: Provides real-time insights into cluster health and application performance, reducing downtime (e.g., 50% MTTR reduction, Gartner 2023).
- **Industry Validation**: Penetration testing mirrors real-world audits (e.g., Airbnb’s 100M+ bookings), ensuring compliance and resilience.
- **Learning Impact**: Equips learners with advanced Kubernetes security and monitoring skills, preparing them for enterprise DevSecOps roles.
- **Model Project**: Serves as a reference for secure, observable Kubernetes deployments, aligning with Fortune 100 standards (e.g., Amazon, Google).
