## 10 Common Terraform Issues and Smart Solutions

### 1. State File Conflicts in Team Environments
- **Issue**: Multiple team members apply Terraform (`infrastructure/terraform/main.tf`) simultaneously, causing state file conflicts in S3, leading to corrupted state and failed EKS cluster updates.
- **STAR Method**:
  - **Situation**: In Phase 2, two engineers run `terraform apply` concurrently, corrupting the state file in `s3://ecomm-tfstate`, halting EKS nodegroup updates.
  - **Task**: Prevent state conflicts to ensure reliable infrastructure updates within 1 hour, maintaining 99.9% uptime.
  - **Action**:
    - **Observability**: Analyzed Terraform error logs (`terraform.log`) and S3 version history to identify conflict.
    - **Automation**: Enabled state locking with DynamoDB in `main.tf` (`backend "s3" { dynamodb_table = "ecomm-tf-lock" }`), created table via AWS CLI.
    - **Security**: Restricted S3 bucket and DynamoDB access with IAM policies (`AWS:Deny` for unauthorized users).
    - **Collaboration**: Updated `docs/runbook.md` with state management guidelines, trained team via Slack.
  - **Result**: State conflicts eliminated, updates completed in 30 min, zero corruption incidents.
- **Senior DevSecOps Architect Contribution**:
  - **Best Practices**: Uses DynamoDB locking (automation), monitors state access (observability), and secures buckets (security-first).
  - **Leadership**: Establishes state governance, aligning with Amazon’s IaC for 1M+ customers (2023).
  - **Proactivity**: Implements state versioning in S3 to recover from errors.
- **Before-and-After Comparison**:
  - **Before**: Conflicts corrupt state, delaying updates by 1-2 days, risking drift (90% drift issues, HashiCorp 2023).
  - **After**: Zero conflicts, updates in <30 min, drift-free infrastructure.
- **Multi-Cloud Relevance**: Applies to GCP (Cloud Storage + Spanner for locking), ensuring consistency across AWS/GCP.
- **Outcome**: Reliable state management, matching Netflix’s IaC reliability (247M subscribers).

### 2. Drift Between Terraform State and Actual Resources
- **Issue**: Manual changes to EKS nodegroup size (e.g., via AWS Console) cause drift from `main.tf`, leading to `terraform apply` errors in Phase 2 when scaling nodes.
- **STAR Method**:
  - **Situation**: Phase 2 scaling fails with `resource already exists` errors, as nodegroup size (4 nodes) differs from state (2 nodes).
  - **Task**: Reconcile drift within 1 hour to restore scaling and maintain 100K+ txns/day.
  - **Action**:
    - **Observability**: Ran `terraform plan` and `aws eks describe-nodegroup` to detect drift.
    - **Automation**: Imported manual changes with `terraform import aws_eks_nodegroup.main ecomm-cluster/ng-1`, updated `main.tf` to match.
    - **Security**: Locked down AWS Console access with IAM policies (`AWS:Deny` for `eks:*` except Terraform roles).
    - **Collaboration**: Added drift detection to `.github/workflows/infra.yml`, documented in `runbook.md`.
  - **Result**: Drift resolved in 45 min, scaling restored, zero manual changes post-fix.
