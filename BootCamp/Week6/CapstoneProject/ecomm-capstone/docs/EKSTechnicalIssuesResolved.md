## 10 Common EKS Issues and Smart Solutions

### 1. Insufficient Node Capacity Leading to Pod Scheduling Failures
- **Issue**: Pods remain in `Pending` state due to insufficient node capacity (e.g., CPU/memory limits exceeded on t4g.medium nodes), delaying application deployment.
- **STAR Method**:
  - **Situation**: During Phase 2, deploying 5 frontend and 5 backend pods overwhelms the EKS cluster’s 2 nodes, causing scheduling failures visible in `kubectl get pods -n prod`.
  - **Task**: Ensure pods schedule promptly to maintain 99.9% uptime and support 10,000+ products/day, as per project goals.
  - **Action**:
    - **Observability**: Analyzed `kubectl describe pod` and CloudWatch Container Insights to confirm resource exhaustion.
    - **Automation**: Configured Karpenter (from Phase 2) to auto-scale nodes based on pod demands, updating `infrastructure/terraform/main.tf` with a Karpenter `NodePool` (e.g., `minSize: 2`, `maxSize: 6`).
    - **Security**: Applied least privilege IAM roles for Karpenter via IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts).
    - **Collaboration**: Documented scaling strategy in `docs/runbook.md` for team reference.
  - **Result**: Pods scheduled within 2 minutes, nodes scaled to 4 during peak, maintaining uptime and reducing scheduling errors by 100%.
- **How a Senior DevSecOps Architect Contributes**:
  - **Best Practices**: Uses Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Karpenter (automation), monitors metrics (observability), and secures scaling with IRSA (security-first).
  - **Leadership**: Guides team on capacity planning, aligning with Amazon’s EKS scaling for 1M+ customers (2023).
  - **Proactivity**: Anticipates load spikes (e.g., Black Friday), ensuring resilience (99.9% uptime, DORA 2023).
- **Before-and-After Comparison**:
  - **Before**: Pods stuck in `Pending` for >10 min, risking outages (1% revenue loss/min, Gartner 2023).
  - **After**: Pods schedule in <2 min, nodes auto-scale, achieving zero scheduling failures and 99.9% uptime.
- **Outcome**: Scalable cluster supporting 100K+ txns/day, matching Netflix’s elasticity (247M subscribers).
